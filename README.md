# python-api-challenge

## Personal Challenges
This was an extrememly difficult assignment for me.  I had issues with importing gmaps, getting hyplot to work, geoapify, etc.  API keys pulled in correctly, but didn't work.  I tried many different items.  Ask BSC was great, when we spent 2 hours trying to figure out why my weatherpy information wouldn't pull through my code.  

So this was a struggle assignment. I did the best that I could. May not have wrote code as expected, but I did what I could to get the homework done. 

## Assignment Portion
The Python API challenge had 2 parts. It asked us to pull in WeatherPy data where we asked to compare information regarding humidity, max temperatures, wind speeds and cloudiness on both sides of the equator.  The VacationPy utilized the pulled in information to look at our ideal locations based on temperatures and pull in information. 

This assignment had us creating data frames, making scatter plots, pulling information form APIs, and (ideally) adding in maps to overlay our data information on.
